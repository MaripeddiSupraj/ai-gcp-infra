## 🎯 HOW WORKFLOWS WORK

### Terraform Workflow (terraform.yml)

**When PR created with .tf changes:**
```
PR created → validate → plan → comment on PR → NO APPLY
```

**When merged to main with .tf changes:**
```
merge → validate → plan → ⏸️ approval-gate → apply → ✅ complete
```

**Key Logic:**
- PR = plan only (no apply)
- Main push = plan + approval required + apply
- Manual dispatch = choose plan/apply/destroy
- All changes tracked in Git

---

### Docker Workflow (docker-build-push.yml)

**When PR created with app changes:**
```
PR created → security-scan → build → scan image → NO PUSH
```

**When merged to main with app changes:**
```
merge → security-scan → build → scan → push ✅ → auto-trigger K8s deploy
```

**Key Logic:**
- PR = build only (no push to registry)
- Main push = build + push + auto-deploy
- All images tracked by tag and SHA
- Auto-triggers Kubernetes deployment

---

### Kubernetes Workflow (ai-k8s-deploy.yml)

**Auto-triggered after docker push:**
```
docker push → auto-trigger → pre-checks → deploy → health-checks → ✅ live
```

**Manual deployment:**
```
gh workflow run ai-k8s-deploy.yml → select env → deploy
```

**Rollback:**
```
gh workflow run ai-k8s-deploy.yml → rollback=true
```

---

## 🚀 WHEN EACH WORKFLOW RUNS

### terraform.yml triggers on:
✅ Push to `*.tf` files (all branches)
✅ Push to `modules/**` directory
✅ Manual workflow_dispatch

**But:**
- PR → plan only
- Main push → plan + approval + apply

### docker-build-push.yml triggers on:
✅ Push/commit to `app/` directory
✅ Push to `requirements.txt`
✅ Push to `Dockerfile`
✅ Manual workflow_dispatch

**But:**
- PR → build only
- Main/develop push → build + push + auto-deploy

### ai-k8s-deploy.yml triggers on:
✅ Auto-trigger from docker-build-push.yml
✅ Manual workflow_dispatch

## 💡 LOCAL vs GITHUB - RECOMMENDATION

### Development Flow:
```
👤 LOCAL:
  terraform fmt -recursive
  terraform validate
  terraform plan
  
  OR
  
  docker build -t app:test app/
  docker run app:test

🤖 GITHUB (after push):
  Automatic validation
  Automatic security scanning
  Automatic testing
  Manual approval (if needed)
  Automatic deployment
```

### When to use LOCAL:
- Quick iteration
- Debugging
- Before pushing
- Learning/testing

### When to use GITHUB:
- Official deployments
- Audit trail
- Multiple environments
- Team collaboration
- Production changes

## 📋 WORKFLOW DECISION MATRIX

| Change Type | Branch | Action | PR Check | Main Deploy |
|------------|--------|--------|----------|------------|
| .tf files | feature | PR | ✓ plan | ⏸️ approval |
| .tf files | main | push | - | ✓ apply |
| app/ | feature | PR | ✓ build | - |
| app/ | main | push | - | ✓ push + K8s |
| both | feature | PR | ✓ both | - |
| both | main | push | - | ✓ tf + docker |

---

## ✅ SAFETY CHECKLIST

- ✅ PR triggers validation only (no apply)
- ✅ Main merge requires approval for Terraform
- ✅ Plan checksums prevent tampering
- ✅ Security scans run before any action
- ✅ Concurrency lock prevents parallel applies
- ✅ Rollback available for quick fixes
- ✅ Health checks verify deployments
- ✅ All changes tracked in Git

---

## 🔍 HOW TO VERIFY EVERYTHING WORKS

### 1. Check Terraform Module
```bash
cd modules/gke
terraform validate
```

### 2. Check Workflow Syntax
```bash
gh workflow list
gh workflow view terraform.yml
gh workflow view docker-build-push.yml
```

### 3. Manual Test Run
```bash
# Dry-run the plan
terraform plan -no-execute -out=tfplan

# Don't apply yet - just verify it works
```

### 4. Check GitHub Secrets
```
GitHub → Settings → Secrets
Should have:
  - GCP_SA_KEY ✓
```

## 🎯 READY FOR PRODUCTION

Your infrastructure is ready to deploy!

**What you can do now:**

1. ✅ Deploy infrastructure via GitHub workflows
2. ✅ Deploy applications automatically  
3. ✅ Run security scans on all code
4. ✅ Get approval gates for safety
5. ✅ Manage multiple environments
6. ✅ Track all changes in Git
7. ✅ Rollback if needed
8. ✅ Monitor deployments

**Next steps:**
1. Add GCP_SA_KEY to GitHub secrets
2. Configure terraform.tfvars
3. Create state bucket in GCS
4. Push to main branch
5. Watch workflows run
6. Approve deployment
7. Done! 🎉
