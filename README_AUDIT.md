## 🎯 Quick Decision Tree

### Question: How much time do you have?

```
2 hours? → Run Phase 1 (cleanup) → Deploy
          (Low risk, 30 min cleanup)

1 day?   → Run Phase 1-2 (cleanup + security) → Deploy
          (Recommended approach, 3 hours)

1 week?  → Run Phase 1-3 (+ K8s improvements) → Deploy
          (Excellent approach, 5.5 hours)

3 weeks? → Run Phase 1-5 (complete) → Deploy
          (Enterprise-grade, 9 hours)
```
